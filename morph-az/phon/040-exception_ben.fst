% $xcptn_ben$: Handling of exception two very particular exceptions 
%   if pronuns `ben' and `sen' gets dative case directly the root
%   changes
%   ben -> ban-a, sen -> san-a
%
% another exceptions with this words are with instrumental "case",
% where they require possessive suffixed 'im/in' before. for now, we
% ignore that, as 'benle' and 'senle' seems to be also common.
