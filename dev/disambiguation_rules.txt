* Remove the first of two consecutive verb parses
* Remove an accusative case marked noun parse before a postposition that subcategorises
    for nominative
* Remove the accusative case marked parse without any possessive marker if the previous 
    form has genitive case marking (signalling a genitive possessive NP construction).
* Select a parse with case feature ablative if the following postposition unambiguously
    governs the ablative
* Select an adjective parse following a determiner-adjective sequence and before a noun
    without a possessive marker.
* Select a nominal form with a Sg2 marker following a pronoun with Sg2 agreement and 
    genitive case.
